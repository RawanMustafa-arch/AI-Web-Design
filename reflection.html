    <h1>Reflection: Using AI Tools for Web Development</h1>

    <h2>Which AI tool(s) did you use?</h2>
    <p>I used ChatGPT as my AI coding assistant. It helped me write responsive CSS media queries, a hamburger menu, and generate parts of the HTML structure for my landing page.</p>

    <h2>How did it help you?</h2>
    <p>The AI helped me quickly produce boilerplate code, understand best practices for responsive design, and troubleshoot issues with the layout. It saved me time and guided me when I wasn't sure how to begin a section.</p>

    <h2>What challenges did you encounter?</h2>
    <p>One challenge was making sure the AI-generated code matched my design theme and didn't break the layout. I also had to tweak the hamburger menu JavaScript to work properly across different screen sizes. Reviewing and customizing the output was necessary.</p>

    <h2>What did you learn overall about using AI for coding?</h2>
    <p>I learned that AI can be a powerful tool for coding support, especially for repetitive tasks or starting code. However, it's important to review and understand the code before using it. AI helps boost productivity, but critical thinking and testing are still essential.</p>
